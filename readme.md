This project is an alternative format for online food blogs.
Most recipe websites either display too much information for an experienced cook, or rely on the reader having a solid understanding of cooking.
This format includes an expanded version of a recipe, including links which explain advanced cooking terms, as well as collapsed version.
The collapsed version is intended for cooks who have either made this dish before, or are simply very experienced and thus do basic steps for preparation of certain ingredients as S.O.P.

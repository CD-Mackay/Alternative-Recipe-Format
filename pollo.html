    <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. 
      Add garlic, cumin, salt, pepper, oregano, and 
      achiote paste<a href="#note-one" onclick="highLightFunctionOne()"> (if using, See Note 1) </a>and cook for several minutes, stirring. 
      Remove from heat and allow to cool. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Put cooled achiote garlic mixture, 
        orange juice, and lime juice in a large
         Ziploc freezer bag. Add chicken pieces, 
         seal bag, and massage chicken and marinate
          2-4 hours or overnight. Any longer will 
          toughen the chicken. We want TENDER. <a href="#note-two" onclick="highLightFunctionTwo()">(See Note 2)</a></li>
          <li>Preheat grill to 350°F to 400°F. 
            Remove chicken from marinade; 
            and set marinade aside.</li>
            <li>Grill chicken, covered, 
              until an instant-read thermometer registers 
              165°F when inserted into thickest portion 
              of each piece. About 20 to 30 minutes.
               I do not turn them over during cooking,
                no need for grill marks.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile while chicken is grilling: 
                  purée marinade and baste chicken often 
                  throughout grilling. Discard when done.</li>

    <h4><strong>Notes</strong></h4>
    <p id="note-one">1. Most achiote paste is packaged in 
      4 ounce cubes.<strong> We will only need 2 
      ounces,</strong> save remainder for another use.
       I break up and smash the achiote paste
        as best I can in the marinade mixture,
         making sure it's blended in. 
         You can also puree in a blender for 
         a smoother mixture after it cools. 
         BELOW is an achiote spice blend substitute,
          enough for this recipe. </p>
    <div id="achiote">
     <h5>Achiote Paste Alternative</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>3 tbsp paprika</li>
      <li>2 tbsp white vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tsp dried Mexican oregano</li>
      <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Combine in a small bowl 
      and use to marinate chicken 
      along with other main recipe 
      seasonings and usually citrus juice.</p>
    </div>
    <p id="note-two">2. Acid bases include vinegar, wine, 
    citrus juice, and tomatoes. 
    Acidic marinades might actually toughen chicken. 
    So when using a highly acidic marinade for chicken, 
    add a little olive oil and/or minimize marinating 
    time. With the garlic, spice and achiote mixture
    included up to overnight (8 hours) is OK.</p>
